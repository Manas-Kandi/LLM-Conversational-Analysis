The fix worked! \n\n**Summary of the bug and solution:**\n\nThe issue was that the function definition line `def greet(name)` was **missing the colon (`:`)** at the end. \n\nIn Python, when defining a function, you must include a colon after the parameter list to tell the interpreter that an indented code block follows. This is a core Python syntax rule that applies to functions, loops, conditionals, and classes.\n\n**The corrected code:**\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    print('Hello ' + name)\n```\n\nThe tool confirmed that with the colon added, the function now executes correctly and outputs \"Hello World\" as expected.

It's a core syntax rule - the same applies to loops, conditionals, and class definitions too.\n\nSo the corrected line should be:\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n```\n\nThis tells Python that the next line (`print('Hello ' + name)`) is the body of the function and should be executed when `greet()` is called.\n\n**Hypothesis**: The syntax error is simply the missing colon after the function parameter list.

Without it, the Python interpreter doesn't know that the `print('Hello ' + name)` line is meant to be the function body. This will raise a `SyntaxError` because the parser expects the colon to start the function's code block.\n\nThis is a fundamental Python syntax rule that applies to all compound statements - function definitions, conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), class definitions, etc. The colon acts as a delimiter telling Python \"here comes a block of code.\"\n\n**Proposed fix**: \n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    print('Hello ' + name)\n```\n\nThe colon signals that the next line should be indented and belongs to the function body.
