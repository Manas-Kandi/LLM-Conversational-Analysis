# Data Directory

This directory contains all project data, organized into:

- **raw/**: Original, immutable data generated by experiments
  - `conversations_json/`: Individual conversation JSON files
  - `research_results/`: Batch experiment results and metadata
- **derived/**: Processed or generated outputs
  - `analysis_outputs/`: CSV/JSON results from analysis scripts
  - `exports_reports/`: Exported reports (moved from exports/)

## Access via Legacy Paths

For backward compatibility, the following symlinks exist at the repository root:
- `conversations_json` → `data/raw/conversations_json`
- `research_results` → `data/raw/research_results`
- `analysis_outputs` → `data/derived/analysis_outputs`

This ensures existing scripts and documentation continue to work without changes.
