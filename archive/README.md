# Archive

This directory is for deprecated or superseded materials that may be useful for reference but are not part of active work.

## What to Archive Here

- Old analysis scripts that have been replaced
- Superseded documentation drafts
- Experimental code that didn't make it into the main codebase
- Old configuration files or templates

## Current Contents

*Currently empty - materials will be moved here as needed.*

## Guidelines

- Add a README note when adding items explaining why they're archived
- Keep folder structure logical (e.g., `scripts/`, `docs/`, `configs/`)
- Do not delete archived items without careful consideration
